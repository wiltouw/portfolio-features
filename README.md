# Cyberpunk-Inspired Transition Module

This is a standalone interactive transition page from my personal portfolio site [willemtouw.com](https://willemtouw.com). Itâ€™s a taste of my creative approach to immersive web design, UI/UX storytelling, and visual theming.

This module is styled as a fictional secure login system for "ARASAKA OS :: SHINOBI v6.2"â€”featuring a boot sequence, authentication flow, terminal commands, and a glyph puzzle that unlocks access to the rest of the portfolio.

> Iâ€™m not open-sourcing my entire site (yet), but I wanted to share this piece to highlight my aesthetic, attention to detail, and interaction logic, I am still improving it and building as I go!

## Some Features

- Fully custom HTML/CSS/JS with no frameworks
- Cyberpunk OS-style boot sequence + login interface
- Interactive secure terminal with real command parsing
- Glyph-based puzzle challenge with puzzle logic + response validation
- Sound design using embedded audio cues -- (working on it)
